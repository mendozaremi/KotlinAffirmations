# KotlinAffirmations
A Kotlin Application used to display Affirmations with images

## What I learned
- To display additional content in a RecyclerView, modify the underlying data model class and data source. Then update the list item layout and adapter to set that data onto the views.

- Use resource annotations to help ensure that the right type of resource ID is passed into a class constructor.

- Use the Material Components for Android library to have your app more easily follow the recommended Material Design guidelines.

- Use MaterialCardView to display content in a Material card.

- Small visual tweaks to your app in terms of color and spacing can make the app look more polished and consistent.
